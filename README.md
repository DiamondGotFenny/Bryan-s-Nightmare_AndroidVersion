# Bryan-s-Nightmare_AndroidVersion
This game is an improvements and modification of The Unity official tutorial-Survival Shooter. I added 3 levels, two alternative weapons (light saber and rifle), more monsters and bosses etc. to the game. 

Due to the file size limit of github, i am not able to upload the whole project files but only the scripts.

please do not use this game for commercial purpose!

This is the first game i made after watching The Unity official's tutorial, i did by my own. I google and watched youtube tutorials while i met problems. That's why this project look disorgnized and has many defects. The game may look not very good, but i'm glad that it is playable, and doesn't have big bug.
